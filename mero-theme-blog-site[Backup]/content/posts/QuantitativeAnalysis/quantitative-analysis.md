As I write am I still learning the ins & out of Quantitative finance & analysis,
these are my own thoughts and opinions about a subject matter that I am interested in.
 
# Origin
My interest in quantitative finance began with my interest in the world of Economy & Finance,
being a Computer Science student I was curious as to how all these fields can be combined and produce live projects.(my prefered way of learning)

I applied for the World Quant University - Applied Data Science Module that consists of 2-eight week units that challenges
students to solve real-world problems through data analysis through a hands on approach. 

World Quant University --> (https://www.wqu.edu/programs/data-science/)

Recommended books to begin include:

1. Yves Hilpisch books:
- Python for Finance, Mastering Data - Driven Finance
- Derivatives analytics with Python - data analysis, models, simulation, calibration and hedging.
